Fintech Case Study - Terra Labs

# HomeWork - Terra Cryptocurrency

## Overview and Origin

* Org Name: Terraform Labs

* When was the company incorporated? 2018

* Who are the founders of the company? Daniel Shin and Do Kwon

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The founders saw a need to marry the idea of a stablecoin with a payment platform. They also had a unique vision for stabilizing the coin, by using the analogy of the pull of the moon (LUNA) on Earth (Terra). 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? Terra Labs has received investor funding from Binance Labs, OKEx, Huobi Capital, Pantera, Galaxy, Jump Capital, XRP Capital, and Dunamu. They have received over $175M in funding.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

The Whitepaper explains the Protocol is designed to create a decentralized, price-stablized cryptocurrency with the potential to gain mass adoption through a unique feature set. This may be achieved using a dual-token model and a set of price-stabilizing algorithms in concert with Luna. However, the interesting part, at least to me, is the Anchor Protocal, which is a lending and saving platform, where staked Luna can earn the stakers 19% on their staked value, currently. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The white paper also describes that, generally, the crypto wallet consumer experience is still clunky for consumers and without a functional ability to transact using the various wallets in broader "real world" application paradigms. So the idea is very br oad general public adoption. Additionally, they've solved three major areas of Finance: money, payments, and investing. There are rumors there is a future platform designed to combine everything, called Alice. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The native token on the Terra blockchain is Luna, which is a stakeable crypto. The interesting value proposition is the algorithmic technology, which steers the Terra stablecoin to stability using a matched pair of algorithms incentivizing the user to take profits either in Luna or Terra coin when the price destabilizes away from the reference fiat (pre-established). That is, the built in arbitrage functionality incentivizes holders of either Luna or Terra (UST) to sell one for the other at a profit, balancing the stablecoin. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 

Terra is in the Crypto/Wallet/Stablecoin business with vast consumer adoption goals. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 

The stablecoin marketplace is exploding with various attempts to peg the coins to various units of measure to try to find the stablest coin. For example, to various currencies, to market indicies, to global trends, etc. Additionally, Covid and monetary policies in the last two years, especially, have hastened the drive towards to financial innovation and inflation-adjacent tools. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? 

Tether, DAI, USD Coin, True USD, Digix Gold, Havven's Nomin, Paxos Standard, Binance USD, among many others. The Federal Reserve is even research a digital version of the dollar.  


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 

The LUNA token has increased in value 25 times this year, rising to about $6 billion in valuation. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? Terra Labs is succeeding by almost any metric. 

The platform is growing in users expanding outside of Korea, the Luna token is growning in value, and investors are circling, looking to get in.  


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

A brain-dead simple user interface that simplifies everything for the general public would change everything, similar to the chai payments app which is a partner of the Terra network. This is the game changer. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 

Users strengthen the platform, the security, the adoption, and demand. But this coin is still on the fringe of the fringe in terms of general "normie" adoption. But growth can happen fast with word of mouth and the general public has heard of the benefits of crypto (and fear). 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The technology of human interface design is not necessarily on the cutting edge of any given stack but it is and always will be an enormous challenge to solve.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The system is well-designed functionality. What it needs is broad adoption and the best way to get there is for the user interface to be as simple as possible.
